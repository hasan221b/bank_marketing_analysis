# bank_marketing_analysis

In this notebook, I conducted an analysis on the bank marketing campaign dataset. I explored various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance to identify the most effective approach.  

The bank marketing campaign dataset is a valuable resource for understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies. With this dataset, I examined the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. 

I implemented several machine learning algorithms, including support victor machine, decision trees, random forests, and KNN. Through careful evaluation and comparison of these models, I measured their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their suitability for the task at hand.
